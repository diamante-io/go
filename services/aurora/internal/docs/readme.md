Aurora is the server for the client facing API for the Diamcircle ecosystem.  It acts as the interface between [diamcircle-core](https://www.diamcircle.org/developers/software/#diamcircle-core) and applications that want to access the Diamcircle network. It allows you to submit transactions to the network, check the status of accounts, subscribe to event streams, etc. See [an overview of the Diamcircle ecosystem](https://www.diamcircle.org/developers/guides/) for more details.

You can interact directly with aurora via curl or a web browser but SDF provides a [JavaScript SDK](https://www.diamcircle.org/developers/js-diamcircle-sdk/reference/) for clients to use to interact with Aurora.

SDF runs a instance of Aurora that is connected to the test net [https://aurora-testnet.diamcircle.org/](https://aurora-testnet.diamcircle.org/).
